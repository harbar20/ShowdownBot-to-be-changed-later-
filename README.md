What is Showdown Bot?
Well, you know Pokemon Showdown? This bot is taking the principles of Showdown and Pokecord and combined the two.

What will it do?
If you know Pokecord, then you have a basic understanding of how it will work. you first start out with picking a starter pokemon, you can choose from all the gens. From there you can level up your Pokemon by talking or battling others. you can catch pokemon as they spawn. where is what you can expect to see from it when it is completed.

  -Battling:
    Like we said before this is taking the principles of Showdown, this means a 6v6 single battle. (in the future there might be an option to do double or triple battles. You will be able to choose the pokemon you caught to battle others.
  
  \-Catching:
    You can catch pokemon when they appear in the server. to catch them you got to use your pokemon knowledge to catch them. This means knowing their name.
 
  -Pokecredits:
    Pokecredits are going to be given when you battle someone and win or lose, as well when you use the daily claim functions. You will be able to use this to buy items or pokemon. (in the near future there might be some gambling involved)
